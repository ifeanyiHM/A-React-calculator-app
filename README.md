# A-React-calculator-app
My first react project from Meta React Basic course in the Meta frontend web development offered on Coursera.
In this project i created a react caculator app that carries out basic calcultor functions.
It was a project to help me get started in react.
I was able to understand the concept of Hooks, and how to pass a function or an object as props and more...
with every challenge comes a degree of growth.
